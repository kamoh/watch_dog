Your dog's escaped into your filesystem... better go find him!

A literal [decade](https://twitter.com/NoNameGhost/status/385974441219731456) in the making, _Watch Dog_ will provide nearly _minutes_ of entertainment for the whole (Bash-literate) family!

### Get Started

Download or clone this repo, `cd` into the directory, and run the game with:
```
  bash watch_dog.sh
```

The game will ask you a few questions, then create a `neighborhood` directory for you to find your dog in!

Once you find your dog, don't forget to `cat [dog_name]` to see what your buddy wants to express sincere gratitude for your effort!
