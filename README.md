Your dog's escaped into your filesystem... better go find 'em!

A literal [decade](https://twitter.com/NoNameGhost/status/385974441219731456) in the making, _Watch Dog_ will provide nearly _minutes_ of entertainment for the whole (Bash-literate) family!

### Getting Started

Download or clone this repo, `cd` into the directory, and run the game with:
```
  bash watch_dog.sh
```

_Note: Starting the game will remove your previous game/neighborhoods, so only restart if you're ready for a brand new experience!_

The game will ask you a few questions, then create a `neighborhood` directory for you to find your dog in!

Once you find your dog, don't forget to `cat [dog_name]` to see how your buddy wants to express sincere gratitude for all your efforts!

And of course, don't forget to bring your dog home with `mv [dog_name] ~/[dog_name]`
